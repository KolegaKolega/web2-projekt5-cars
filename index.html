    <div>
        <b>Description :</b>The Venom F5 boasts an exciting claimed a top speed of 301 mph, which knocks the previous top-speed figure
        by more than a school zone speed limit. To get this magic done, Hennessey started with a brand new,
        2,950-pound carbon fibre chassis and bolted a 1600-hp, 7,4-liter,
        twin-turbo V8 to it. Not to mention, the results are astonishing.
        The Venom F5 can go from 0 to 249 to 0 mph in less than 30 seconds.

    <li><b>Koenigsegg Agera RS: 278 MPH</b></li>
    <br>
    <div>
        <b>Description :</b>No doubt regarding specs, Hennessey's Venom F5 is the most impressive car on the chart,
        but when it comes to verified speed, Koenigsegg Agera RS is the ultimate winner. For the official record,
        Koenigsegg asked the NDT (Nevada Department of Transportation) to block Route 160 between Las Vegas and Pahrump,
        which stretches across
        a distance of 11-mile. The Agera RS hit the speed of 284.55 mph during its first run.
